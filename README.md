**Hello, I'm Muhammad Hassan 👋**

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a Computer Science student currently exploring the world of coding and development. I'm new to the field but passionate about learning and expanding my skill set in various programming languages and tools.

**📚 What I'm Learning**

I'm currently focusing on the following:

Java - Getting familiar with object-oriented programming concepts.
PHP - Working on creating dynamic web applications.
HTML & CSS - Learning the basics of web design to build responsive and visually appealing websites.
MySQL - Understanding database management and SQL queries for data storage and retrieval.
Excel & Word - Developing proficiency in handling data and documentation.

**🌱 My Goals**

I'm aiming to:

Master the basics of programming and web development.
Build small projects to apply my learning and improve my coding skills.
Contribute to open-source projects as I grow my knowledge.
Document my learning journey on GitHub, so I can track my progress and share it with others.

**🛠 Projects**

Since I'm still learning, my projects are simple and educational. Here are a few examples:

University Management System (PHP, MySQL): A basic CRUD application for managing student and course data.
Library Management System (Java): An OOP-based console application for managing books and borrowers.
Personal Website (HTML & CSS): My personal web page where I'm practicing layout and styling.

**📈 Current Skills**

Basics of HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL
Fundamental Java programming
CRUD operations in MySQL
Excel & Word basics for data analysis and documentation

**🚀 Future Plans**

I'm excited to dive deeper into JavaScript, advanced MySQL, and project-based learning. I also hope to learn Git to contribute to collaborative projects!
